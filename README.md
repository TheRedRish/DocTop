This project is a Windows XP–themed documentation website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and served with Express.
The website acts like a virtual desktop — complete with a wallpaper, taskbar, and clickable “files.”
Each file opens a Word-style window containing documentation for topics covered in the course, such as Node.js, Express, Git, and terminal commands.

The design recreates the nostalgic Windows XP interface while presenting technical content in a structured, interactive way.
Later, the project will be refactored to use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Express templates.
